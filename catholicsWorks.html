                <p>“Protestants believe in faith alone, while Catholics believe in faith and works.” You hear 
                    both Protestants and Catholics say this all the time.
                    But it’s a misleading oversimplification. If you tell a typical Evangelical, “You believe in faith alone,
                     but we Catholics believe in faith and works,” you will cause him to think that the 
                     Catholic Church teaches something that, in fact, it says is false.
                    Here’s why . . .

                <h3>The justification connection</h3>
                <p>The discussion of faith and works doesn’t take place in a vacuum. It occurs in a specific 
                    context—the doctrine of  <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=justification+definition+bible&sca_esv=fd6552c9c3fda5e1&sca_upv=1&sxsrf=ACQVn0_W0gFM6fcVs-tSEhTqGNXbAnAb5w%3A1711567732184&source=hp&ei=dHMEZreHCbT5kPIPlOWS-AY&iflsig=ANes7DEAAAAAZgSBhAPWfJuQRl7cBnJPcfB23HzxDh4C&oq=justification+&gs_lp=Egdnd3Mtd2l6Ig5qdXN0aWZpY2F0aW9uICoCCAEyExAAGIAEGIoFGJECGLEDGEYY-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&sclient=gws-wiz" 
                    target="_blank">justification</a></p>
                
                    <p>The New Testament uses the word justification to refer to one of the things that God does 
                        for us by his grace. Unfortunately, there is considerable disagreement about what
                         justification involves.</p>

                    <p>The way typical American Evangelicals use the term, when God justifies someone, he
                         declares that person’s sins forgiven and proclaims the person righteous. This is occurs at 
                         the beginning of the Christian life, when a person first turns to God.</p>

                    <p>As far as it goes, this description is accurate. Catholic theology would say that there is
                         more to justification than that, but it is true that at the beginning of the Christian life God
                          forgives a person’s sins and declares him righteous.</p>

            </div>


            <div class="content-text-three">
                <h3>Faith Alone</h3>
                <p>When Protestants use the phrase “faith alone,” they are describing how we are justified.
                     The idea is that in order to come to God, be forgiven, and be declared righteous, you don’t
                      need to do anything to earn your place before God except have faith in Jesus Christ.</p>

                <p>In practice, Protestants give different meanings to the “faith alone” formula. Lutherans, for
                    example, don’t see the idea that baptism grants salvation as conflicting with this.</p>

                <p>In his Small Catechism, Martin Luther asks, “What does baptism give? What good is it?” His
                     answer: “It gives the forgiveness of sins, redeems from death and the devil, gives eternal 
                     salvation to all who believe this, just as God’s words and promises declare.”</p>

                <p>Various Protestants—including some Calvinists, Anglicans, Methodists, and others—believe
                     baptism plays a role in salvation, but others sharply disagree. Some—particularly 
                     Baptists—claim that if baptism were to play a role in salvation it would violate the “faith 
                     alone” formula. They thus understand this formula in a way that excludes baptism. This is
                      the most common position in American Evangelicalism.</p>

                <p>Regardless of how they interpret the “faith alone” formula, there is one thing that
                     Protestants agree would violate this formula: works. “Works”—whatever they may be—are 
                     precisely the thing that the “faith alone” formula is meant to exclude.</p>

                <p>Much can be said about what “works” are in the Bible, but, for reasons of space, we won’t
                     be going into that here. It will do for our purposes to note that most Evangelicals 
                     understand the term to mean “good works” (feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, etc.). 
                     Some understand it even more broadly to mean anything that you do.
                </p>
                
                <p>Both groups commonly envision works as somehow earning our place before God.</p>

                        
            </div>


            <div class="content-text-four">
                <h3>Faith and Works?</h3>
                <p> if a Catholic tells a Protestant, “We believe in justification by faith and works,” it will cause 
                    the Protestant to believe something about Catholic doctrine that is not true.</p>

                <p>Remember: Protestants use the term justification to refer to an event at the beginning of
                     the Christian life where God forgives us and declares us righteous. As a result, a Protestant 
                     will think that the Catholic is saying that we need to do works in order to come to God and 
                     be forgiven.</p>

                <p>This will confirm his biases against the Church and play into all those stereotypes left over 
                    from the Reformation—the ones where Catholics are depicted as holding a false gospel 
                    according to which we need to earn our place before God by our own efforts. But the 
                    Catholic Church does not teach this.</p>

            </div>


            <div class="content-text-five">
                <h3>The Council of Trent on Justification</h3>
                <p>Following the Protestant Reformation, the Catholic Church held an ecumenical council in 
                    the Italian city of Trent to deal with the theological questions that were being debated. The
                     Council of Trent issued the Decree on Justification (DJ), which set forth the Catholic 
                     position on the subject.</p>

                <p>In the heat of the times, Protestant leaders painted the Council of Trent as a great villain 
                    that simply reiterated the Church’s false teachings and its false gospel. That 
                    characterization is still found today in a lot of Protestant literature on the subject.</p>

                <p>But if you read what Trent says, you find it actually denies much of what is attributed to it. 
                    This is the case with the idea that we need to earn our place before God by doing works—
                    particularly at the beginning of the Christian life when we are first justified</p>

                <p>According to Trent, “none of those things that precede justification, whether faith or 
                    works, merit the grace of justification. ‘For, if by grace, it is not now by works, otherwise,’ 
                    as the Apostle says, ‘grace is no more grace’” (DJ 8, quoting Rom. 11:6).</p>

                <p>When we come to God and are justified, it happens without any merit on our part. Neither 
                    our faith nor our works—nor anything else—merits justification. Trent thus denies the very
                     thing our Protestant brethren fear it asserts—and that we lead them to believe if we tell 
                     them simply that we believe in “justification by faith and works.”</p>


            </div>



            <div class="content-text-six">
                <h3>Isn;t that our language</h3>

                <p>Given how common the “justified by faith and works” language is in some Catholic circles,
                     the idea that we should be careful using it with Protestants may seem unfamiliar. “Isn’t the 
                     language we use when summarizing our beliefs about justification?” one might ask.</p>

                <p>It depends on whom you mean by “we.” Many Catholics use this as a kind of top-level
                     summary of justification, but you don’t find the magisterium—the Church’s teaching 
                     authority—using it that way.</p>


                <p>If you go through Trent’s Decree on Justification, or the section on justification in the 
                    Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC 1987-1995), you won’t find the phrase “faith and 
                    works.” And you won’t find the word works at all in the Catechism’s section on justification.</p>

                <p>This may be surprising, but the fact that the magisterium does not express its teaching in 
                    this way is a signal that we need to look more closely at what it says.</p>

            </div>


            <div class="content-text-seven">
                <h3>What about James 2:24?</h3>

                <p>A key question at this point is how the magisterium handles James 2:24, which says that
                     we are “justified by works and not by faith alone.”</p>


                <p>In popular discussions, this verse is often presented to Protestants as if it proves that we 
                    are justified by faith and works, with nothing more to be said. Confronted with this claim, 
                    the Protestant may respond, “But that’s not the kind of justification that James is talking
                     about.”</p>

                <p>Before dismissing this claim, a Catholic should be aware of one thing: The magisterium 
                    agrees with it. At least, the magisterium doesn’t quote James 2:24 in connection with the
                     justification that occurs at the beginning of the Christian life. Instead, it refers it 
                     to something else.</p>
