            <div class="Content">
                <p>Protestants claim the Bible is the only rule of faith, meaning that it contains all of
                     the material one needs for theology and that this material is sufficiently clear that one does 
                     not need apostolic tradition or the Church’s magisterium (teaching authority) to help one
                     understand it. In the Protestant view, the whole of Christian truth is found within the 
                     Bible’s pages. Anything extraneous to the Bible is simply non-authoritative, unnecessary,
                      or wrong.</p>


                <p>Catholics, on the other hand, recognize that the true “rule of faith”—as expressed in 
                    the Bible itself—is Scripture plus apostolic tradition, as manifested in the living teaching
                     authority of the Catholic Church, to which were entrusted the oral teachings of Jesus and 
                     the apostles, along with the authority to interpret Scripture correctly</p>



                <p>In the Second Vatican Council’s document on divine revelation, Dei Verbum (Latin: “The
                     Word of God”), the relationship between Tradition and Scripture is explained: “Hence there
                      exists a close connection and communication between sacred Tradition and sacred 
                      Scripture. For both of them, flowing from the same divine wellspring, in a certain way 
                      merge into a unity and tend toward the same end. For sacred Scripture is the word of God 
                      inasmuch as it is consigned to writing under the inspiration of the divine Spirit. To the
                       successors of the apostles, sacred Tradition hands on in its full purity God’s word, which 
                       was entrusted to the apostles by Christ the Lord and the Holy Spirit.

                </p>


                <p>“Thus, by the light of the Spirit of truth, these successors can in their preaching preserve
                     this word of God faithfully, explain it, and make it more widely known. Consequently it is
                      not from sacred Scripture alone that the Church draws her certainty about everything 
                      which has been revealed. Therefore both sacred Tradition and sacred Scripture are to be 
                      accepted and venerated with the same devotion and reverence.”</p>


                <p>But Evangelical and Fundamentalist Protestants, who place their confidence in Martin 
                    Luther’s theory of sola scriptura (Latin: “Scripture alone”), will usually argue for their 
                    position by citing a couple of key verses. The first is this: “These are written that you may
                     believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his
                      name” (John 20:31). The other is this: “All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for
                       teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness; so that the man of 
                       God may be equipped, prepared for every good work” (2 Timothy 3:16–17). According to
                        these Protestants, these verses demonstrate the reality of sola scriptura (the “Bible only” 
                        theory).</p>


                    <p>Not so, reply Catholics. First, the verse from John refers to the things written in that book 
                        (read it with John 20:30, the verse immediately before it to see the context of the
                         statement in question). If this verse proved anything, it would not prove the theory of sola 
                         scriptura but that the Gospel of John is sufficient.</p>


                    <p>Second, the verse from John’s Gospel tells us only that the Bible was composed so we can
                         be helped to believe Jesus is the Messiah. It does not say the Bible is all we need for 
                         salvation, much less that the Bible is all we need for theology; nor does it say the Bible is 
                         even necessary to believe in Christ. After all, the earliest Christians had no New Testament
                          to which they could appeal; they learned from oral, rather than written, instruction.</p>

                    <p>Much the same can be said about 2 Timothy 3:16-17. To say that all inspired writing “has 
                        its uses” is one thing; to say that only inspired writing need be followed is something else.
                         Besides, there is a telling argument against claims of Evangelical and Fundamentalist 
                         Protestants. John Henry Newman explained it in an 1884 essay entitled “Inspiration in its 
                         Relation to Revelation.”</p>


                      <div class="Content-Two">
                        <h3>Newman's argument</h3>
                        <p>He wrote: “It is quite evident that this passage furnishes no argument whatever that the
                             sacred Scripture, without Tradition, is the sole rule of faith; for, although sacred Scripture 
                             is profitable for these four ends, still it is not said to be sufficient. The Apostle [Paul] 
                             requires the aid of Tradition (2 Thess. 2:15). Moreover, the Apostle here refers to the scriptures which Timothy was taught in his infancy.</p>

                        <p>“Now, a good part of the New Testament was not written in his boyhood: Some of the 
                            Catholic epistles were not written even when Paul wrote this, and none of the books of the
                             New Testament were then placed on the canon of the Scripture books. He refers, then, 
                             to the scriptures of the Old Testament, and, if the argument from this passage proved 
                             anything, it would prove too much, viz., that the scriptures of the New Testament were not
                              necessary for a rule of faith.”</p>

                        <p>Furthermore, Protestants typically read 2 Timothy 3:16-17 out of context. When read in the 
                            context of the surrounding passages, one discovers that Paul’s reference to Scripture is 
                            only part of his exhortation that Timothy take as his guide Tradition and Scripture. The two 
                            verses immediately before it state: “But as for you, continue in what you have learned and 
                            have firmly believed, knowing from whom you learned it, and how from childhood you
                             have been acquainted with the sacred writings which are able to instruct you for salvation
                              through faith in Christ Jesus” (2 Tim. 3:14–15).</p>


                        <p>Paul tells Timothy to continue in what he has learned for two reasons: first, because he 
                            knows from whom he has learned it—Paul himself—and second, because he has been 
                            educated in the scriptures. The first of these is a direct appeal to apostolic tradition, the 
                            oral teaching which the apostle Paul had given Timothy. So Protestants must take 2 
                            Timothy 3:16-17 out of context to arrive at the theory of sola scriptura. But when the
                             passage is read in context, it becomes clear that it is teaching the importance of apostolic 
                             tradition!</p>

                        <p>The Bible denies that it is sufficient as the complete rule of faith. Paul says that much Christian teaching 
                            is to be found in the tradition which is handed down by word of mouth (2 Tim. 2:2). He instructs us 
                            to “stand firm and hold to the traditions which you were
                             taught by us, either by word of mouth or by letter” (2 Thess. 2:15)</p>


                        <p>This oral teaching was accepted by Christians, just as they accepted the written teaching that came to them later
                            . Jesus told his disciples: “He who hears you hears me, and he who rejects you rejects me” (Luke 10:16). The Church, in the persons of the apostles, was given the authority to teach by Christ; the Church would be his representative. He commissioned them, saying, 
                            “Go therefore and make disciples of all nations” (Matt. 28:19).</p>

                        <p>And how was this to be done? By preaching, by oral instruction: “So faith comes from what is heard, and
                             what is heard comes by the preaching of Christ” (Rom. 10:17). The Church would always be the living teacher. 
                             It is a mistake to limit “Christ’s word” to the written word only or 
                            to suggest that all his teachings were reduced to writing. The Bible nowhere supports either notion.</p>

                            <h3>What is Tradition</h3>
                            <p>In this discussion it is important to keep in mind what the Catholic Church means 
                                by tradition. The term does not refer to legends or mythological accounts, nor does it 
                                encompass transitory customs or practices which may change, as circumstances warrant, 
                                such as styles of priestly dress, particular forms of devotion to saints, or even liturgical
                                 rubrics. Sacred or apostolic tradition consists of the teachings that the apostles passed
                                  on orally through their preaching. These teachings largely (perhaps entirely) overlap with 
                                  those contained in Scripture, but the mode of their transmission is different.</p>


                            <p>Paul illustrated what tradition is: “For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also 
                                received, that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures. . . . Whether then
                                 it was I or they, so we preach and so you believed” (1 Cor. 15:3,11). The apostle praised 
                                 those who followed Tradition: “I commend you because you remember me in everything 
                                 and maintain the traditions even as I have delivered them to you” (1 Cor. 11:2).

                            </p>

                            <p>The first Christians “devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching” (Acts 2:42) long before
                                 there was a New Testament. From the very beginning, the fullness of Christian teaching 
                                 was found in the Church as the living embodiment of Christ, not in a book. The teaching Church, 
                                 with its oral, apostolic tradition, was authoritative. Paul himself gives a quotation 
                                 from Jesus that was handed down orally to him: “It is more blessed to give than to receive” (Acts 20:35).</p>


                            <p>Fundamentalists say Jesus condemned tradition. They note that Jesus said, “And why do
                                 you transgress the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?” (Matt. 15:3). Paul 
                                 warned, “See to it that no one makes a prey of you by philosophy and empty deceit,
                                  according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the universe, and not 
                                  according to Christ” (Col. 2:8). But these verses merely condemn erroneous human
                                   traditions, not truths which were handed down orally and entrusted to the Church by 
                                   the apostles. These latter truths are part of what is known as apostolic tradition, which is to be 
                                   distinguished from human traditions or customs.</p>


                            <div class="Content-Four">
                                <h3>Commandments of Men</h3>
                                <p>Consider Matthew 15:6–9, which Fundamentalists and Evangelicals often use to defend
                                     their position: “So by these traditions of yours you have made God’s laws ineffectual. You
                                      hypocrites, it was a true prophecy that Isaiah made of you, when he said, ‘This people does 
                                      me honor with its lips, but its heart is far from me. Their worship is in vain, for 
                                      the doctrines they teach are the commandments of men.’” Look closely at what Jesus said.</p>

                                <p>He was not condemning all traditions. He condemned only those that made God’s word
                                     void. In this case, it was a matter of the Pharisees feigning the dedication of their goods to 
                                     the Temple so they could avoid using them to support their aged parents. By doing this,
                                      they dodged the commandment to “Honor your father and your mother” (Ex. 20:12).</p>

                                    <p>Elsewhere, Jesus instructed his followers to abide by traditions that are not contrary to 
                                        God’s commandments. “The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses’ seat; so practice and 
                                        observe whatever they tell you, but not what they do; for they preach, but do not practice”
                                         (Matt. 23:2–3).</p>

                                    <p>What Fundamentalists and Evangelicals often do, unfortunately, is see the word “tradition”
                                         in Matthew 15:3 or Colossians 2:8 or elsewhere and conclude that anything termed a
                                          “tradition” is to be rejected. They forget that the term is used in a different sense, as in 1
                                           Corinthians 11:2 and 2 Thessalonians 2:15, to describe what should be believed. Jesus did 
                                           not condemn all traditions; he condemned only erroneous traditions, whether doctrines or
                                            practices, that undermined Christian truths. The rest, as the apostles taught, were to be obeyed.</p>

                                        <h3>The Indefectible Church</h3>
                                        <p>How can we know which traditions are apostolic and which are merely human? The 
                                            answer is the same as how we know which scriptures are apostolic and which are merely
                                             human—by listening to the magisterium or teaching authority of Christ’s Church. Without
                                              the Catholic Church’s teaching authority, we would not know with certainty which
                                               purported books of Scripture are authentic. If the Church revealed to us the canon of 
                                               Scripture, it can also reveal to us the “canon of Tradition” by establishing which traditions
                                                have been passed down from the apostles. After all, the New Testament itself declares the 
                                                Church to be “the pillar and foundation of the truth” (1 Tim. 3:15).</p>
