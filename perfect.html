            <p>You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ 
                But I say to you, love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you, so that 
                you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for he makes his sun rise on the evil 
                and the on good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. For if you love those
                 who love you, what reward have you? Do not even tax collectors do the same? And if 
                 you salute only your brethren, what more are you doing than others? Do not even 
                 the Gentiles do the same? You, therefore, must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is
                  perfect (Matt. 5:43-48).</p>
        </div>



        <div class="Content">
          <p>Matthew 5:48, the sentence that closes the above biblical passage, is brief and riveting.
             Poised at the center of the Sermon on the Mount, this Gospel exhortation is a critical 
             teaching moment in the life of Jesus and a critical moment of revelation for all his disciples. 
             It is the moment where Jesus sums up his teaching by issuing a clarion call for us to
              transform ourselves into an image of God’s own holiness, that we may transform the
               entire world into the kingdom of God.
            </p>

            <p>Asking us to transform ourselves into something that resembles God could seem
                 blasphemous, both to Jews in Jesus’ days and to Christians in our own time. After all, 
                 it might be interpreted to suggest that Jesus is giving us hope that we too might somehow
                  achieve a state of perfection that allows us to have a divine status.</p>

            <p>Jesus is simply not claiming this. By telling us to “be perfect as your heavenly Father is
                 perfect,” our Lord is saying we have an opportunity to become fully human by imitating
                  the loving qualities of God. Such a conversion has many implications. It cannot be an 
                  individual affair with God. If we are to emulate the type of selfless love that radiates from
                   God, the true hallmark of our conversion will be our ability to conduct ourselves in ways 
                   that allow our words and our deeds to show others the love of God.</p>

                <p>The word “perfect” as used by Matthew deserves attention. “Perfect” is used just twice in 
                    all of the Gospels, both times by Matthew, who places the word again in 19:21, when Jesus 
                    explains to the rich young man that to “be perfect,” to find his true “treasure in heaven,” he 
                    must give his wealth to the poor and follow the way of Jesus. In both the Sermon on the
                     Mount and the interaction with the rich young man, Jesus uses the word “perfect” to 
                     demand a certain type of moral behavior that will reflect our attempt to know God fully 
                     and to therefore always seek his will in our lives.</p>

                    <p>To describe the type of perfection Jesus is trying to convey in both 5:48 and 19:21,
                         Matthew uses the Greek word teleios, an adjective which defines something as being 
                         complete, something which is “whole,” “fully grown,” “final.” Teleios may itself be a 
                         translation of the Semitic word tamim, which also conveys something which has become 
                         “whole” and “complete.</p>

                    <p>It is significant that Jesus’ exhortation to “be perfect” comes within the context of 
                        the Sermon on the Mount, in which Jesus teaches us the virtues essential to the Christian life: 
                        the necessity of prayer, the absence of anxiety over material things, and the 
                        incompatibility of hypocrisy, self-righteousness, and selfishness with philanthropy. But the 
                        Sermon cannot be limited to the status of a “how-to” guide for clean living. Here Jesus is
                         offering us the opportunity to participate in something much greater than our human
                          selves, something more vast than what we can know in the here and now.</p>


                        <p>This special moment of teaching by Christ is on par with the dramatic revelations of the 
                            <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=old+testament&sca_esv=631c077ebeab8f5b&sca_upv=1&sxsrf=ACQVn0-5UOYQyxdI4FjYAkiN4Us2sjqN9A%3A1711638860005&source=hp&ei=S4kFZpuiO9uikPIP9cGRyAY&iflsig=ANes7DEAAAAAZgWXXBn4WVueYZPe-4ErjBTB0Ng6LgvL&gs_ssp=eJzj4tDP1TcwzUmxNGD04s3PSVEoSS0uScxNzSsBAF0UCAg&oq=old+testman&gs_lp=Egdnd3Mtd2l6IgtvbGQgdGVzdG1hbioCCAEyBxAjGLECGCcyDRAuGAoYgwEYsQMYgAQyBxAAGIAEGAoyBxAAGIAEGAoyBxAAGIAEGAoyChAAGIAEGAoYsQMyBxAAGIAEGAoyBxAAGIAEGAoyBxAAGIAEGAoyBxAAGIAEGApIthdQAFiDC3AAeACQAQCYAWygAcYHqgEDOC4zuAEByAEA-AEBmAILoAL1B8ICExAuGIAEGIoFGMcBGK8BGI4FGCfCAgQQIxgnwgIKECMYgAQYigUYJ8ICERAuGIAEGIoFGJECGMcBGNEDwgIXEC4YgAQYigUYkQIYsQMYgwEYxwEY0QPCAgsQABiABBixAxiDAcICDhAuGIAEGLEDGMcBGNEDwgILEC4YgAQYsQMY1ALCAggQABiABBixA8ICFBAuGIAEGIoFGJECGLEDGMcBGNEDwgIIEC4YgAQYsQPCAgoQABiABBiKBRhDwgIFEAAYgATCAhoQLhiABBiKBRiRAhixAxiDARjJAxjHARjRA8ICCxAAGIAEGIoFGJECwgILEAAYgAQYigUYkgPCAg4QLhiABBiKBRiRAhixA8ICCxAuGIMBGLEDGIAEwgILEC4YgAQYxwEYrwHCAg4QLhiABBjHARivARiOBcICCxAuGK8BGMcBGIAEmAMAkgcDNy40oAfuigE&sclient=gws-wiz" 
                            target="_blank"></a> Jesus, ascending a mountain before he begins to reveal his teaching, 
                            imitates Moses, who also ascended a mountain to receive the law revealed from God. 
                            Jesus’ words, drawn from the Old Covenant then interpreted more deeply and reborn as 
                            the New Covenant, are uttered as a prophetic vision of another world, astonishing those 
                            who hear them. Viewed in the eschatological light in which Matthew intended, the Sermon 
                            on the Mount becomes then not simply a lecture on morals by a benevolent philosopher-it 
                            becomes epiphany straight from the mouth of God.
                        </p>

                        <p>By describing the type of perfect behavior to which we should.aspire, Jesus is giving us a 
                            glimpse of what eternal life will be like in the kingdom of God: a life that is capable only
                             of knowing peace, a life that is free from anxiety and filled with hope, a life that is loving and 
                             can only promote good. By illuminating for us the qualities that we should display to one
                              another, Jesus is describing for us the very qualities that God himself displays toward us 
                              and all creation. The most remarkable of these qualities-and the one seemingly most 
                              beyond human reach-is God’s capacity to pour out his love upon those unworthy of it.</p>


                              <p>This section regarding the love of one’s enemies is found in what is referred to as the
                                 Sermon’s “antitheses,” the six paragraphs in Matthew chapter five that draw explicitly 
                                 upon some piece of contemporary Jewish Scripture interpretation. The format for each
                                  antithesis is the same: Jesus presents a contemporary Jewish interpretation, sometimes 
                                  pointing to its virtues, then takes the teaching a step further, either interpreting
                                   the teaching in a new light or expanding on it in such a way that it demands more than 
                                   the original letter of the law.</p>


                                   <p>Jesus begins the passage by recalling interpretation of some that it was acceptable to “hate
                                    your enemy” (Matt. 5:43). This is not a scriptural commandment but an element of proto
                                    -rabbinical tradition that said one should “reject what God has rejected.</p>

                                  <p>We Jews,” the thinking went, “are the people of God, chosen especially by God to fulfill 
                                    some special plan. It makes sense that we should keep ourselves apart from those whom
                                    God has not chosen.” Heard, then, through the ears of many Jews of Jesus’ day, who had
                                     been taught that hating an enemy is a good, even godly, thing, Jesus’ admonition to “love 
                                     your enemies and pray for those who persecute you” would have been shocking.</p>

                                    
                                     <p>The Christians-both Jewish and Gentile-for whom Matthew wrote his account of the 
                                        Sermon on the Mount would have found Jesus’ commandment to “love your enemies” 
                                        equally difficult. According to some theories, Matthew wrote in Antioch five decades after 
                                        Jesus delivered his sermon. If so, he would have been acutely aware of, and likely even
                                         addressing, the bitter divide within Judaism between the Pharisees and the increasingly 
                                         popular Christian movement. Even closer to the heart of the matter would be Matthew’s 
                                         recognition that Gentiles-those who had not been circumcised and taught to keep 
                                         the Mosaic Law-often had embraced the Christian faith more readily than had many Jews. 
                                         Thus, at times there was friction in the Antiochene church between the Old Testament-
                                         abiding Jewish minority and a Gentile majority that was bound only by Christian precepts.</p>

                                     <p>In such an environment, tensions caused by religious leaders and cultural influences could
                                         mount, sides be taken concerning the place of the Mosaic Law in the Christian life, and 
                                         enemies be made. To be told that one must reach out in true love to someone from the 
                                         “other side” would have struck a nerve with many in the Antiochene community.</p>


                                      <p>Still, an exhortation to charity would not have been unusual in the society in which
                                         Matthew’s Gospel was written. Before Christianity, and even outside of it, fairly palatable 
                                         standards of conduct toward others, including one’s enemies, were promoted. The Old
                                         Testament, for instance, admonishes us to give aid to one’s enemies in certain
                                          circumstances; and the Stoic and Cynic philosophers of Jesus’ day did emphasize that we 
                                          should all love one another. But extending these aphorisms to the point of actually acting 
                                          with love to an enemy-and thereby negating our ability to act with hate is a teaching which
                                           seems to have come uniquely from Christ.</p>


                                        <p>Those who first heard the Sermon on the Mount were “astonished” at Jesus’ teaching
                                             (Matt. 7:28) and would have considered such a love beyond anything that we, left to our
                                              own devices, could ever muster. And this is precisely what Jesus was telling them: Such a
                                               love, he was saying, could never come simply from within or be a product of mere 
                                               humanity. A love of enemies would have to be an imitation of the divine love that God
                                                extends to each of us, regardless of whether or not we deserve it (we don’t), want it (not 
                                                frequently enough), or will ever return it (impossible in like measure). And if under 
                                                the influence of God’s grace we can exhibit such a love, we will be participating, in advance, in 
                                                God’s new, recreated world where no hatred or sin will exist: a world like the perfect world
                                                 he created for us in the first place, only more glorious, which will exist only when his
                                                  kingdom is finally at hand.</p>

                                            <p>With the blunt admonition that we are to “be perfect” as our “heavenly Father is perfect,” 
                                                Jesus in condenses the larger vision of the Sermon on the Mount, a vision that may be 
                                                translated as: “You are to build the kingdom of God with love.” We who expect to find 
                                                ourselves within that kingdom, he is telling us, must not only look forward to it as a future
                                                 possibility but must believe that the kingdom can, in part, become a current reality
                                                  and must participate in the building of that reality. Capping his extraordinary teaching that we
                                                   are to express only love, even to those who may hate us in return, Jesus reminds us that,
                                                    to achieve a whole, complete, unbreakable union with God, we must imitate God. We 
                                                    must, like Jesus, direct all the energies of our humanity into reflecting the love of the
                                                     divinity. It is a pure love so overwhelming that it can only become a force for good, a love 
                                                     that will one day overpower the world to usher into its place the eternal kingdom of God.</p>
